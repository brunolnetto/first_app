# "Do you wanna develop an app?"
(Glootie)

Hi, this is my first app, but you can interpret it as a service. 

You may utilize some cloud service to host the app, like AWS, Azure or GCloud, but in this case you might run locally. In this case I used Postgresql as database. 

You must follow the instructions below

1) Clone the repository typing on terminal `git clone git@github.com:brunolnetto/first_app.git`;
2) Run the bash script "setup.sh" with command `bash setup.sh` to create the database, user and tables locally;
3) Run the command `node server.js` to run the server locally;
4) Open a browser;
5) Type `localhost:8080/submit` on the URL field;
6) Type your name on "Name" and a message on respective field.
